# Week 4 Questions

## How are our users moving through the product funnel?

| total_sessions  | dropoff_session_to_pv_percentage | dropoff_pv_to_atc_percentage | dropoff_atc_to_checkout_percentage |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
|      696        |             24.14                |              9.09            |              16.67                 |   

There are 696 distinct sessions with page_views, add_to_cart and checkout.There was a 24% dropoff between total sessiona and page_views, 9% dropoff from page_views to add_to_cart and then 17% dropoff from add_to_cart to checkout.

## Which parts of the funnel are doing well?

Seems like users are adding their products to cart due to a lower drop off rate from viewing the product page.

## Which parts are struggling? Why might that be?

Only 76% from total sessions had a page_view. We would to understand what part of the application they are on during the session. Is there another event_type that occurs before the page_view? 

The dropoff between add_to_cart and checkouts might just be due to users being fickle about their purchase. As a user myself, I tend to leave items on the cart just to get the total so I can compare prices from another website.
